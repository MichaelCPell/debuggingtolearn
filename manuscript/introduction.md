# Introduction 

When we've exhausted all other options: the docs don't make sense, the tutorials don't seem to work, Stack Overflow does not have any of the answers, and no one is going to help us, we only have one choice.  We have to ask the machine itself.  This can be a dreary place.  But it need not be, it can be the most exciting time of all, when we get to use all of the parts of our higher faculties to discover new knowledge and 

The code we want to have does not exist yet.  The knowledge we don't have does not exist yet.  This is a book about using the princples of debugging to write the code that we do not yet know how to write.  We will use debugging to obtain the knowledge that we do not yet have.  This is not about fixing bugs that are due to careless error.  This is about using debugging and experimentation to learn things that we acknowledge we do not already know about our systems.

The Scientific Method Applied to Learning Software Systems.

## Why 'Debugging' is useful but ought to be presented from a different angle.


Some of you may be familiar with the book "Debugging" by David J. Agans.  The first rule from Debugging is "Understand the System."  But for us, this is exactly the problem, we are trying to learn how the system works.  In this chapter, he writes, "You have to understand how things are supposed to work if you want to figure out why they don't."

The next rule is "Read the Manual."  But again, we have the chicken and the egg problem.  Until we know something about programming we will not be able to make sense of the manual.  Perhaps, if we *could* read the manual then we *would* and we would not be in this problem to begin with.  That said, I agree with Agans, no one actually reads the manual until they have to...


The code we want to have does not exist yet.  The knowledge we don't have does not exist yet.  This is a book about using the princples of debugging to write the code that we do not yet know how to write.  

## This book is targeted at intermediate learners

I am not going to explain syntax

## Language Examples:  Ruby and Javascript

Most people I know who are learning to code these days are learning either Ruby or Javascript.  Therefore these are the languages that we will use in our examples.  As usual, the theory and pattern should apply to any language.


## The Scientific Method

Everything that you will read in this book can be summed up simly as "Use the Scientific Method."  This method has been around for 100s of years by its current, formal name, and before that was considered common sense.

## The Truth

You will probably not use a formal method everytime you need to debug your code. Many of the techniques will become second-nature.  However, when you are really stuck, then that is the time to open the book once again and use the techniques that our forebears used to get us where we are today.

## Bugs are Living Things, they possess your code like demons, and our job is to exorcise them.

Bugs are a part of the evil that lives in the universe.  Were it not for this evil, we would all right perfect code and live perfect lives without making mistakes.  This evil is within us, yes, but we do not have to accept it as a part of us.  It is our duty to make sure that the things that we create are not left with this residual evil.  Therefore it is our duty to hunt down and squash every last bug that our imperfect minds create in our software.  It makes the universe a better place.
