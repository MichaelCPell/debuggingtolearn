## Blind Guessing

For some reason the human brain loves doing this.  It is addicting to just throw some logic against the wall and see if it sticks.  It is also hopeless.  Sure a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and again, but most of them die first.  
Blind Guessing is the starting point of any problem-solving endeavour and it is also the most expensive in terms of critical thinking.  Instead, you should use the tools and habits discussed in this book to improve your blind guesses.  Even a slightly-less-blind guess is going to give you better odds of success than a totally blind guess.
