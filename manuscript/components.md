# Components

Programming languages may seem immense and impossible to learn.  But first you must realize that every function or data structure in a language is composed of the same 6 basic building blocks.  These are the entire logic of any programming language.  Mostly everything you encounter while writing code and algorithms can be decomposed into these logical components.

Next time you are working through an algorithm and feel lost or stuck, take a look at this list.  Understand that in order to write your algorithm you are going to be limited to a very finite set of components.  From there you must be a creative problem solver.

## Data
These are guaranteed to be a part of your solution.  Data is the blood and energy of any algorithm.  The objective of most functions is to transform data from a starting state to a final state.  Data takes the form of Primitives and Variables.


* Primitive Types
	
	Like strings, integers and booleans.


* Variables

	These usually just give special names to your primitive types, and let you store them.

## Logical Structures and Expressions
At least one of these logical structures also guaranteed to be a part of your solution.  As more of the logical structures are incorporated, and as they are combined to work together with one another, the complexity of the algorithm increases.

"The Four"

1. Basic Math

	You learned this in elementary school.


2. If/Else Statements

	This is the simplest way to make your program smart.  Like 
	`if light is red, then do not drive through intersection`.  

3. Loops
	
	You use these when you want to complete the same process multiple times.  Often times you will use a variable to change the purpose of the loop on each iteration.

	Like 
		```
		while(location != destination)
			continue_driving
		end
		```
	
4. Comparison Operators

	These are used for deciding if one value is equal to a different value.

	5 == 5 is true
	10 == 5 is false
