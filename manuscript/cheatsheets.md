Create Cheat Sheets for each of the 4 components.


1. Basic Math

	1. % Modulus Operator
	2. Floats vs Integer


2. If/Else Statements

	if 
	elsif
	elsif
	elsif
	else
	end

	case "value":
	when value:
	when value:
	when value:
	else
	end


3. Loops
	
	You use these when you want to complete the same process multiple times.  Often times you will use a variable to change the purpose of the loop on each iteration.

	Like 
		```
		while(location != destination)
			continue_driving
		end
		```
	
4. Comparison Operators

	These are used for deciding if one value is equal to a different value.

	5 == 5 is true
	10 == 5 is false
