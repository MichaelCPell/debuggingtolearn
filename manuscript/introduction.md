# Introduction 

When we've exhausted all other options: the docs don't make sense, the tutorials don't seem to work, Stack Overflow does not have any of the answers, and no one is going to help us, we only have one choice.  We have to ask the machine itself.  This can be a dreary place.  But it need not be, it can be the most exciting time of all, when we get to use all of the parts of our higher faculties to discover new knowledge and best of all we are doing it ourselves.  In this book I will teach you how to manage the conversation  between you and your computer.

The code we want to have does not exist yet.  The knowledge we we need in order to write that code does exist, but it lives within the computer.  But the computer is worse than the sphinx when it comes to revealing its secrets.  Therefore we need the right tools, methods, and strategy in order to get leverage over the computer and make it tell us what we want to know.  

But this is not Abu Ghraib, we cannot use force to make the computer tell us its secrets.  And this is not school, we cannot read the computer's secrets from the manuals.  If we could read the manuals we would probably not be stuck.  No, the only tool we have at our disposal is the same that the scientist uses in order to extract truth and understanding from the natural world: we must design experiments and make trials.


The Scientific Method Applied to Learning Software Systems.


## This book is targeted at intermediate learners

I am not going to explain syntax.  You should be able to work your way around the application you are working on well enough to conduct experiments.

## Language Examples:  Ruby and Javascript

Most people I know who are learning to code these days are learning either Ruby or Javascript.  Therefore these are the languages that we will use in our examples.  As usual, the theory and pattern should apply to any language.


## The Scientific Method

Everything that you will read in this book can be summed up simly as "Use the Scientific Method."  This method has been around for 100s of years by its current, formal name, and before that was considered common sense.

## The Truth

You will probably not use a formal method everytime you need to debug your code. Many of the techniques will become second-nature.  However, when you are really stuck, then that is the time to open the book once again and use the techniques that our forebears used to get us where we are today.
