# Rules

These are questions that you should be able to ask yourself while you are in the process of completing MVE's.  They provide ways to help you unstick yourself when you are actually conducting your experiments.


## Is there anyway you can make this experiment simpler?  Can you make it test or accomplish less?

This is the most important rule.  In order to learn any part of the system or its behavior, you need to make the part or change that you are analyzing as small as possible.  

## Where have you done something similar?  Are there any examples from our own code that we can use as models here?

## How can be validate our assumptions?
