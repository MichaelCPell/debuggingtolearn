## Critical Thinking as a Fuel with a Finite Supply

Let me give you a metaphor: Your brain is a machine that inputs information and outputs code.  But this reaction does not take place on its own.  No, energy is required to produce the reaction.  In this case, your brain requires **critical thinking** in order to transform information into code.  Critical thinking is expensive on your mind.  It makes your brain very tired, that is, critical thinking is a limited resource and you must spend it very wisely. Developing the endurance to think critically for a long period of time is important.  This comes from practice and mental exercise.

Since your brain is just a machine like any other, it is also susceptible to inefficiencies.  We ought to do our best to avoid these inefficiencies.  Our most major concern is **distraction and focus**.  So much of the world is designed to distract you from what you ought to be focusing on.  Not only do distractions prevent you from focusing on what you need to do, 


But the Law of Conversation of Energy tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed.  

## Friction as you Learn
Your brain is a human brain.  While we train it to think more logically and accustom our brains to the stubborness of the computer's purely logical processes we can expect a great amount of friction between the two.  You might think you are stupid.  You might be angry at the computer.  It is not the computer's fault.  Go take a walk.  With lots of time and deliberate pratice the computer will become an extension of your mind and coding will not be so painful.
