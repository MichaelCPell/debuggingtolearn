## Blind Guessing

For some reason the human brain loves **making random guesses without any research or critical thinking**.  It is addicting to just throw some logic against the wall and see if it sticks.  It is also hopeless.  Sure a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and again, but most of them die first.  
Blind Guessing is the starting point of any problem-solving endeavour and it is also the most expensive in terms of critical thinking.  Instead, you should use the tools and habits discussed in this book to improve your blind guesses.  Even a slightly-less-blind guess is going to give you better odds of success than a totally blind guess.

## Seeking 3rd Party Help Too Soon

I have known many coding apprentices to begin looking for 3rd-party help before they have even considered the problem themselves.  This is a big mistake.  In most cases, blog posts and Stack Overflow answers are relevant at best to your problem at hand.  Every problem is unique.  Therefore you should at least give your problem your best shot at finding its unique solution before looking for a similar problem and solution.  

**False similarity** is one of the downfalls of looking for your answers somewhere else.  You think that by reading a blog post you are going to find a solution to your own problem.  But really you find a solution to someone else's problem.  Now you have doubled your work, because you have had to understand two problems and hopefully two solutions.

I understand that this is in direct contrast to the earlier recommendation that you should use other working examples as a model.  Two things are important: (1) You should learn from other working examples that you are already able to understand. (2) As always, the smaller the problem the better.  If you have minimized the problem that you are trying to solve, then it should not cost so much to understand a second smaller problem and its solution.
