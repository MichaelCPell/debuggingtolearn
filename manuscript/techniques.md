## Input/Output Analysis

The IO Analysis will be the starting point for most of your experiments.

## Start with 'puts'

`puts` and `console.log` are useful for testing your assumptions.  As you should already know, we use them to print to the log or console.  They are the most primitive method of debugging and therefore the easiest to implement.  When you are thinking about how the system works, you are changing data in one way or another at each of the steps.  The more steps between the starting point and the behavior that you are expecting, the more places for your bug to live.  
The success of each of these is an assumption until you have printed these values or return values to the console and can verify that what you think you know is in fact so.
