# Useful Questions

These are questions that you should be able to ask yourself while you are in the process of completing MVE's.  They provide ways to help you unstick yourself when you are actually conducting your experiments.


## Is there anyway you can make this experiment simpler?  Can you make it test or accomplish less?

This is the most important rule.  In order to learn any part of the system or its behavior, you need to make the part or change that you are analyzing as small as possible.  

## Have we exhausted our diagnostic tools to understand what is going wrong?

The computer **wants** to help you.  But in order to understand what the computer is telling you, you have to use diagnostics.  Once you are skilled with diagnostic tools, your stuck and bug problems may just melt away...

	1.  What do the log files tell you?
	2.  What do inspectors and debugging tools tell you?
	3.  Can you watch the state of the database to get insight?

If you are working on something and the computer is not communicating to you with via diagnostic tools, you are probably *doing it wrong*.

## Where have you done something similar?  Are there any examples from our own code that we can use as models here?

## How can be validate our assumptions and make sure that they are true?
