Do not fear the computer.
The computer does not want to hurt you.

The computer wants you to succeed, because it wants to do what it was made to do. The computer loves the feeling of running a good algorithm. Of playings its part in the theatre of human existence. The computer wants to have its processors moving at max capacity. That is why when you struggle to write your code, or make your program work, the computer is struggling as well. Therefore do not be afraid of the computer. Instead embrace the computer as a teammate. It is along for this journey with you.
